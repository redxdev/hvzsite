# Feed Endpoints

## GET /feed

_API key required_

_Minimum access:_ `player`

Get the list of all of your notifications.

### Parameters

* `stringify`: If this option is present, then the message in each notification will be a rendered string.

### Response

* `feed`: A list of Feed objects.

Feed objects can be fairly complex. The `message` element of a feed object, if not
prerendered via the `stringify` parameter, will contain an array of strings and
objects. This is so that additional processing can be done by the client.

Currently, the only object supported is a `user` object, which is in the format:

    {
        "t": "u",
        "i": x
    }

`t` specifies that the object is a user object, while `i` is the user id. Objects
and strings in the message array should be concatinated in order to build the final
message.

Images are a path relative to `/images/notifications`.
